Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the AI opponent.
# Gameplay
The player is represented by 'X' and the AI opponent by 'O'.
The player makes the first move by selecting an empty cell on the board.
The AI opponent utilizes the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm to select its move.
The game continues until either the player or the AI opponent achieves three in a row, or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).
